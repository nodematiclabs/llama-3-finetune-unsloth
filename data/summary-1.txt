The story follows the journey of the starship Elysium and its crew, who become lost in an uncharted region of space after being pulled into a wormhole. They discover an inhabitable planet called Terra Nova, where they uncover the ruins of an ancient, advanced civilization that had destroyed itself through the misuse of its own technology. From these ruins, the crew recovers invaluable knowledge, including alien propulsion technology that allows them to return to Earth.

Upon their return, humanity establishes diplomatic ties with an alien civilization called the Vaeridians, leading to the construction of an Interstellar Peace Monument on a neutral planetoid called Nexus Point. This monument symbolizes humanity's newfound role in the cosmos as partners in exploration and the shared pursuit of knowledge with other civilizations.

The core morale of the story is that true exploration is not just about reaching new destinations or making discoveries, but about building connections and understanding between different peoples. It emphasizes the importance of using advanced technology responsibly and respecting the lessons of the past to create a future of peace, unity, and collaboration among all sentient beings in the cosmos.
